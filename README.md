# Y1basicWebsiteDevelopment
It is a fundamental website development module where it includes html, css and JavaScript.

This's a group assignment where is made up by a total of 4 students.

Each members are responsible for two webpages. In my case, mine was the contact and Join Us webpage.
Most of the components are build based on the lecture and tutorials I had. The additional components which is not covered in the class was the google map from the Join Us page. API was being used for creating a map inside our website.
